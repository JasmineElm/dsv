# Manipulating Data

When analysing univariate data, we focus on its overall shape and characteristics. Key questions include:

- Location and spread of data points: What are the typical, minimum, and maximum values?
- Distribution pattern: Are data points evenly spread or clustered?
- Data set size: Is it large or small?
- Symmetry: Is the distribution symmetric or skewed?
- Tail weight: Are there many points far from the center, or are outliers rare?
- Clusters: Number, location, and size of any clusters.
- Outliers: Presence of significantly different data points.
- Other features: Any unusual aspects like gaps, sharp cutoffs, or peculiar values.
  Even simple data sets can reveal complex features.
