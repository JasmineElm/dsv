# Working with Unexpected Values

## Univariate Data Analysis

_Univariate data analysis_ is the simplest form of data analysis. It involves
the analysis of a single variable, focusing on its distribution and
characteristics. Univariate data analysis is a fundamental step in data
analysis, as it provides insights into the structure and properties of the data.

When analysing univariate data, we focus on its overall shape and
characteristics. Key questions include:

- Location and spread of data points: What are the typical, minimum, and maximum
  values?
- Distribution pattern: Are data points evenly spread or clustered?
- Data set size: Is it large or small?
- Symmetry: Is the distribution symmetric or skewed?
- Tail weight: Are there many points far from the center, or are outliers rare?
- Clusters: Number, location, and size of any clusters.
- Outliers: Presence of significantly different data points.
- Other features: Any unusual aspects like gaps, sharp cutoffs, or peculiar
  values. Even simple data sets can reveal complex features.

<!--TODO: create janky dataset that demonstrates typical errors -->

The dataset [here](../Activities/bad_data.csv) contains a number of errors that
you might encounter when working with data. Your task is to identify these
errors. How might you correct them?

## Missing Values

Consider the following dataset:

| ID  | Name | dob        | phone      |
| --- | ---- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1   | John | 01/01/1980 | 0123456789 |
| 2   | Jane | 02/02/1990 | 9876543210 |
| 3   | Jack |            | 1234567890 |
| 4   | Jill | 04/04/2000 | 2345678901 |

At a glance, we can see that the third row is missing a date of birth.
