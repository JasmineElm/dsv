## Multivariate Data Analysis

So far, we've looked at how to identify and handle unexpected values in our data
on a column-by-column basis. In this section, we will look at how to analyse
multiple variables together to identify patterns and relationships between them.
This is known as multivariate data analysis and is a more complex form of data
analysis that requires advanced statistical techniques and tools.

_Multivariate data analysis_ involves the analysis of multiple variables to find
patterns and relationships between them. It is a more complex form of data
analysis that requires advanced statistical techniques and tools. Multivariate
data analysis is used to identify correlations, clusters, and trends in the
data.

When analysing multivariate data, we focus on the relationships between
variables and how they interact with each other. Key questions include:

- Correlations: How do variables relate to each other? Are they positively or
  negatively correlated?
- Clusters: Are there groups of variables that are closely related to each
  other?
- Trends: Are there patterns or trends in the data that can be identified?
- Outliers: Are there any data points that are significantly different from the
  rest of the data?
- Other features: Any unusual aspects like gaps, sharp cutoffs, or peculiar
  values. Even simple data sets can reveal complex features.

A good first step in multivariate data analysis is to consider univariate data
analysis for each variable in the dataset. This will quickly highlight any
issues with individual variables and provide a solid foundation for further
analysis. One we are satisfied that the data doesn't contain (m)any missing
values and is generally clean, we can move on to multivariate data analysis.

From there, we can create a correlation matrix. This matrix shows the
relationships between variables, with values ranging from -1 to 1. A value of 1
indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicates a perfect negative
correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation. By examining the correlation
matrix, we can identify which variables are closely related and which are not.
We can then use this information to identify patterns and trends in the data.
For example, if two variables are highly correlated, we can use this information
to make predictions about one variable based on the other. The correlation
matrix can also help us identify outliers and other unusual aspects of the data,
that are not immediately obvious from univariate analysis.

## Activity 4.1.2

_Allow 30 minutes_

The dataset [here](../Activities/multivariate_data.csv) contains a number of
variables. Your task is to create a correlation matrix to identify relationships
between these variables. Use the techniques described above to create a
correlation matrix and identify any patterns or trends in the data.
