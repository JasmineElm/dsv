# Data Cleansing

Data cleansing is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt
or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database. It refers to
identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate, irrelevant, or missing parts of
the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.
Data cleansing is an essential part of data management and is a crucial step in
data analysis. In databases, a common practice is to develop solutions to ensure
captured data is clean before it is written to the database. This is often done
through the use of constraints and triggers.

In the previous section we discussed how to identify unexpected values in our
data. In this section, we will look at how to handle these issues, and cleanse
our data to ensure that it is accurate and reliable. Data cleansing is an
essential step in the data analysis process, as dirty data can lead to
inaccurate results and misleading conclusions. Data cleansing involves a variety
of techniques, including data imputation, outlier detection, and data
transformation.
