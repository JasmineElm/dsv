# Data Cleansing

Data cleansing is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt
or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database. It refers to
identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate, irrelevant, etc. parts of the
data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting them. The process of data
cleansing includes data auditing, workflow specification, workflow execution,
post-processing, and controlling.

In the previous section we discussed how to identify unexpected values in our
data. In this section, we will look at how to handle these issues, and cleanse
our data to ensure that it is accurate and reliable. Data cleansing is an
essential step in the data analysis process, as dirty data can lead to
inaccurate results and misleading conclusions. Data cleansing involves a variety
of techniques, including data imputation, outlier detection, and data
transformation.
