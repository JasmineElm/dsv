# 7.4: Lying with data

Data visualisation is a powerful tool for communicating data. However, it can
also be used to mislead. In this section, we will look at some common ways data
visualisation can misrepresent data. We should attempt to avoid these pitfalls
when creating visualisations.

### Misleading Axes

Misleading axes can artificially inflate or deflate the apparent size of
differences in data. For example, consider the following bar chart:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
plt.bar(range(len(data)), data)
plt.yticks([0, 2, 4, 6, 8])
plt.show()
```
