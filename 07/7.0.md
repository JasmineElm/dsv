# Week 7: Data Visualisation

Following on from Last week, we will continue our exploration of data
visualisation. This week we will look at how to visualise data to effectively
communicate our findings in a way our audience can understand. Data
Visualisation is a broad topic that covers everything from simple Bar Charts to
complex 3D visualisations. We will look at the different types of visualisations
and when to use them. We will also look at how to use visualisation to explore
trends and patterns in the data.

## How to use your time this week

This week will have both theoretical and practical components. You will be using
tools and techniques to conduct data visualisation and present your findings.
The majority of your time should be spent on the activities and exercises.
