# Ethics in Data Science

You'll cover fundamental ethics in other modules, but there are a couple of
ethical considerations that are particularly relevant to data science. These
are:

- asymmetries of information
- biases in data
- privacy and security

### Asymmetries of Information

An asymmetry of information gives the party with more information an advantage
in a transaction. Asymmetries of information are when one party in a transaction
has more information than the other. This gives the party with more information
an advantage in the transaction. For instance, if you are buying a used car, the
seller knows more about the car than you do. This means that the seller has an
advantage in the transaction. This is an example of an asymmetry of information.

In [Week One](Week_1-Introduction.md) we considered the Financial Crisis
of 2008. No single factor caused to the financial crisis, and no single person
knew the risks. Instead it was a combination of asymmetries of information that
led to the crisis. The crisis was caused by this combination of partial truths:

**Borrowers** knew that they were taking on risky loans, but they believed that
they would be able to refinance or sell their homes before the rates went up.
**Lenders** knew that the loans they were offering were risky, but they believed
that the risk was spread across the financial system, so they would not be
affected if the loans went bad. **Investment Banks** knew that the MBS they were
buying were potentially risky, but they believed that the underlying mortgages
were sound. **Regulators** knew that the financial system was taking on more
risk, but they believed that the market would self-correct.

The lenders had more information than the borrowers, the investment banks had
more information than the lenders, and the regulators had more information than
the investment banks. This meant that the risks were not fully understood, and
the consequences were not fully appreciated.

## Activity 6.1.1:

_Allow 1 hour_

look up the seminal paper on this subject by George Akerlof, "The Market for
Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism" (1970). This paper is a
classic in the field of economics and is a clear example of how asymmetries of
information can affect markets.

### Privacy and Security

Data science relies on data, and data is often personal. This means that data
science can raise privacy and security concerns. It is important to be aware of
these concerns and to take steps to protect privacy and security.

There are laws and regulations that govern the use of data. For instance the
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) seeks to limit the use of personal
data and to protect the privacy of individuals. It has

Whilst these uses are important, it is also important to remember that data
science can be used for good or for bad. It is important to be aware of the
ethical implications of data science and to use data science responsibly.
@zuboffAgeSurveillanceCapitalism2019 argues that data science is being used to
manipulate people and to control society. She argues that data science is being
used to create a new form of power that she calls "surveillance capitalism". It
is important to be aware of these issues and to use data science responsibly.

## Activity 6.1.2
_Allow 30 minutes_
Shoshana Zuboff argues that data science is being used to manipulate people and to control society. Watch this video of her discussing the themes that underpin her book "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism" and consider the ethical implications of data science.

Zuboff's ideas have been widely discussed and debated. For instance, Yiannis Varoufakis has expanded on Zuboff's ideas in his book "Another Now". In this book, Varoufakis argues that data science is being used to create a new form of power that he calls "technofeudalism". It is important to be aware of these issues and to use data science responsibly.

## Activity 6.1.3
_Allow 1 hour_
Listen to [this podcast](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/episode-201-transcript-bkx3e-37rkx-bpl83-ysc9b-kkg62) where Varoufakis discusses the themes that underpin his book "Another Now" and consider the ethical implications of data science.

These somewhat dystopian views of massive companies capturing, controlling and manipulating data for their own ends are not the only narrative. As we saw in week two, open data can be a force to empower citizens and hold governments to account. 

For instance, data science can be used to predict the spread of diseases, to predict the weather, and to predict the outcome of elections. It is important to be aware of the ethical implications of data science and to use data science responsibly.

## Activity 6.1.3
_Allow 30 minutes_

The NHS collects general practice data for planning and research purposes. This data is used to improve patient care and to plan services. The data is collected in a way that intends to protects patient privacy and security.

Read the NHS guidance on the collection of general practice data and consider the ethical implications of using data science in this way.

### Discussion

Although the NHS claims "rigorous processes in place to ensure that data we manage is collected, processed and stored securely", campaigners have claimed the type of data collected 

## Activity 6.1.3
_Allow 1 hour_
Building on the themes Zuboff discusses, consider the ethical implications of using data science to predict behaviour. Read the following article and consider the ethical implications of using predictive analytics in this way.




### Target's Predictive Analytics

In 2012, Forbes reported that Target (a major supermarket in the US) had sent a
teenager a coupon book for expectant mothers @hillHowTargetFigured2012. The
teenager's father was furious, but when he went to the store to complain, he
found out that his daughter was indeed pregnant. Target had used predictive
analytics to predict that the teenager was pregnant based on her shopping
habits. Whilst likely apocryphal @piatetskyDidTargetReally2014, this story
illustrates the power of predictive analytics and the ethical implications of
using data science.

## Activity 6.1.4
_Allow 30 minutes_

The New York Times has a more nuanced take on this story. Read the article and
consider the ethical implications of using predictive analytics in this way.
