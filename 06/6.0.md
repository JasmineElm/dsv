# Week 6: Exploratory Data Analysis

This week, we will be looking at exploratory data analysis. Exploratory data
analysis is a fundamental concept in statistics and data science. It allows us
to explore the data and to understand its structure and patterns. We will look
at the different techniques and tools that we can use to explore the data and to
draw insights from it. We will also look at how to visualise data to quickly
explore trends and patterns. Visualisation is a broad topic, and one that will
be revisited later in the course. By the end of this week, you will be able to
conduct exploratory data analysis and present your findings in the context of
your data science projects.

## How to use your time this week

This week will have both theoretical and practical components. You will be using
tools and techniques to conduct exploratory data analysis and present your
findings. The majority of your time should be spent on the activities and
exercises.
