# Data Science and Visualisation


This is a placeholder for course materials I am creating for a Data Science and Visualisation module.  This should be treated as _very_ alpha quality.

The course is delivered in ten blocks.  Ideally students will study these over ten weeks rather than bite the whole thing off in a single week.

## [Week 1](Week_01-Introduction.md)

In week one, we will introduce the subject and give you a flavour of what you can expect.

## [Week 2](Week_02-Finding_Data.md)

In week two, we will look at how to find and evaluate existing datasets.

## [Week 3](Week_03-Extracting_Data.md)

In week three, we will look at how to extract data from various sources.

## [Week 4](Week_04-Manipluating_Data.md)

In week three, we will look at how to manipulate data.

## [Week 5](Week_05-Hypothesis_Testing.md)

In week five, we will look at hypothesis testing.

## [Week 6](Week_06-Exploratory_Data_Analysis.md)

In week six, we will look at exploratory data analysis.

## [Week 7](Week_07-Visualisation.md)

In week seven, we will look at how to visualise data.

## [Week 8](Week_08-Storytelling.md)

In week eight, we will look at how to tell stories with data.

## [Week 9](Week_09_Other-Tools.md)

In week nine, we will look at other tools that can be used in data science and visualisation.

## [Week 10](Week_10-Presentations.md)
