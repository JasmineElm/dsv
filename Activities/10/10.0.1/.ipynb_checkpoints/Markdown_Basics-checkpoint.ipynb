    "## What is Markdown?\n",
    "\n",
    "The original markdown syntax was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004.  Gruber wanted a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. It is\n",
    "designed to be easy to read and write, and to be converted to HTML. Markdown is\n",
    "often used to write documentation, README files, and other types of text that\n",
    "need to be formatted in a structured way. Markdown files are easy to read \"raw\",\n",

    "Jupyter and RStudio both have built-in markdown processors that allow\n",
    "you to view your markdown files as they will appear when rendered.\n",

    "## Markdown Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown uses a simple syntax to format text. Here are some of the most common\n",
    "elements of markdown syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Element         | Syntax                                          |\n",
    "| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| Headers         | `# Header 1`<br>`## Header 2`<br>`### Header 3` |\n",
    "| Emphasis        | `*italic*`<br>`**bold**`                        |\n",
    "| ordered Lists   | `1. item 1`<br>`2. item 2`                      |\n",
    "| unordered list  | `* item 1`<br>`* item 2`                        |\n",
    "| Links           | `[link text](url)`                              |\n",
    "| Images          | `![alt text](url)`                              |\n",
    "| Code            | `` `code` ``<br>` ```syntax`<br>`code block`<br>```     |\n",
    "| Blockquotes     | `> blockquote`                                  |\n",
    "| Horizontal rule | `---`                                           |\n",
    "| Paragrah        | `text separated by`<br><br>`two carriage returns`                                          |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables are not part of the original markdown syntax, but are supported by many markdown processors, including Jupyter and RStudio. There are number of different ways to create tables in markdown, but the most common is to use a simple syntax that uses pipes (`|`) to separate columns, and hyphens (`-`) to separate the header row from the content rows. Here is an example of a simple table in markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "| Column 1     | Column 2     | Column 3     |\n",
    "|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n",
    "| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |\n",
    "| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can align content in the columns by using colons (`:`) in the header row. For example, to align the content in the first column to the left, the content in the second column to the center, and the content in the third column to the right, we would use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "| Left-aligned  | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |\n",
    "|:------------- |:--------------:| -------------:|\n",
    "| Left          | Center         | Right         |\n",
    "| Left          | Center         | Right         |\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Escaping Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to include a character that has a special meaning in markdown, you can escape it by putting a backslash (`\\`) in front of it. For example, to include an asterisk (`*`) in your text without it being interpreted as an emphasis marker, you would write `\\*` instead of `*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown Dialects\n",
    "\n",
    "The original specification of markdown is quite spartan and does not include things such as footnotes, checkboxes, or strikethrough text.  To address this, several different dialects of markdown have been created that add additional features to the original syntax.\n",
    " Some of the most popular markdown dialects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM): A dialect of markdown that is used on GitHub.\n",
    "  GFM adds several features, such as task lists,\n",
    "  tables, and syntax highlighting for code blocks.  This is used in Jupyter\n",
    "- R Markdown: A dialect of markdown that is used in RStudio \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many others, such as `commonMark`, `Pandoc`, and `kramdown`. Though these dialects can offer additional features, the basic syntax of markdown is common across all of them. This means that you can write markdown files that are compatible with multiple markdown processors, and that will render correctly in different environments.  A good rule of thumb is to stick to the basic markdown syntax, and avoid using features that are specific to a particular dialect. If you find a feature that you need such as MathJax, you can always write that in HTML.\n"
