# Activity 10.0.4

This notebook shows a simple plotting example. Expand this as you see fit.

```{r}
# load the ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
# The `wt` column is currently set to 1000s of pounds
# we should convert it to a more obvious unit
cars <- mtcars
# set a pound to kilo variable
lbtokg <- 0.453592
# multiply the column by our variable to return the value in tonnes
cars$wt <- cars$wt * lbtokg 
```


```{r}
# plot the data
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
    geom_point(color = "blue") +
    # add a trend line, do not show the confidence
    geom_smooth(method = "lm",
                se = TRUE,
                color = "red",
                alpha = 0,
                show.legend = FALSE,
                formula = y ~ x) +
    # set the labels
    xlab("Miles per Gallon") +
    ylab("Weight (Tonnes)") +
    # remove all visual cruft
    theme_classic() +
    # add a title
    ggtitle("Miles per Gallon vs. Weight") +
    # and centre it
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

This plot demonstrates the  correlation between Weight and its miles per gallon performance; the higher the weight, the lower the performance.
