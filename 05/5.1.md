# 5.1: Types of Hypothesis Tests

Before we can begin to understand hypothesis tests, we need to understand the
different types of hypothesis tests that are commonly used in data science.
Hypothesis tests are used to determine if there is a significant difference
between two groups or if a relationship exists between two variables. There are
many different types of hypothesis tests, but they can be broadly categorized
into two groups: parametric and non-parametric tests.
