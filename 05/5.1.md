## Context

Context is the information that surrounds the data. It is the information that
tells us what the data is about. Fundamentally, data without context is
meaningless. Data with context is _information_ Context is essential both in
understanding the raw data, and presenting our findings. Without context, we
cannot hope to understand whether our analysis is accurate or not.

Often, the context is not explicit in the data. It is up to the data scientist
to find the context, and to use it to interrogate the data. This is why data
science is as much an art as a science. It is the art of finding the context,
and using it to interpret and present the data.

## Activity 4.1 How many trees are there on our planet?

This question was posed by David Spiegelhalter in his book "The Art of
Statistics" @spiegelhalterArtStatisticsLearning2019. How could we possibly
answer this? We could jump into looking at forests and working out the density
of trees, and extrapolating a value from that, but there is a more fundamental
first step, we need to know _what is a tree_? Fortunately for us, there are
definitions we can use.
