# Introduction

Welcome to the course. This course is designed to give you a practical
introduction to data science and visualisation. As a Masters-level course, it is
expected that you will be able to work independently and to a high standard.
This course is designed to give you the skills you need to be able to work with
data and to present your findings in a clear and compelling way.

There is a temptation when teaching technical subjects to either dive straight
into the practise or theory. This course attempts to try to balance the two; as
we introduce a topic, we will have activities that will allow you to practise
what you have learned. This will help you to understand the theory, and to see
how it is applied in practice. Data science, like all technical subjects is a
skill that is best learned by doing, so as you work through the course, please
try to apply the learning to your own data. If you don't have any data, we
discuss sourcing datasets in week [two](../02/2.0.md). In week
[three](../03/3.0.md), we will look at different methods of data collection,
from databases through to web scraping. This will give you a good grounding in
the different ways that data can be collected, and the different types of data
that you may encounter. Having data is part of the battle, we also need to
ensure that the data is clean and that it is in a format that we can use. This
is discussed in week [four](../04/4.0.md). We will look at how to clean data,
and how to manipulate it so that we can use it in our analysis. Week
[five](../05/5.0.md) will look at hypothesis testing, and how we can use
statistical techniques to test our hypotheses. Week [six](../06/6.0.md) will
look at exploratory data analysis, and how we can keep our analysis truthful.
Week [seven](../07/7.0.md) considers data visualisation, how we can best
communicate our findings. Week [eight](../08/8.0.md) builds on this by
considering how storytelling can communicate our findings. Week
[nine](../09/9.0.md) looks at case studies, and how the techniques we have
learned may be applied in practice. Week [ten](../10/10.0.md) will take a closer
look at the tools and techniques that we have used throughout the course. This
will give you a good grounding in the tools that are used in industry, and how
you can use them to further your career.

## Learning Outcomes

This module intends to furnish you with the skills and knowledge to be able to
become a data scientist. More specifically, you will be able to:

1. Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of data analytics, modelling and
   management
2. Apply and critically evaluate various analytical software tools for modelling
   and managing data
3. Visualise data, recognise patterns, communicate knowledge and inform decision
   making for organisations to create value, improve performance and create
   business opportunities.
4. Gain critical understanding of data analytics' challenges and be able to
   interpret the results from data and data analytics' algorithms

## Activity 1.0.0

_allow 1 hour_

> Look at the module guide and the assessment briefs. Make sure you understand
> what is expected of you and what you need to do to pass the module. Make sure
> you understand the deadlines and the assessment criteria. Whilst the
> terminology may be unfamiliar at this stage, it should give you an
> understanding of what is required, when. If you have any questions, let your
> tutor know. It is a good idea to get the deadlines in your calendar now, so
> you can plan your time effectively.

## How you should use your time

| Section   | Theme                                   | Time         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1.0       | Introduction                            | 1 hour       |
| 1.1       | What is Data Science?                   | 2 hours      |
| 1.2       | Data Literacy                           | 1 hours      |
| 1.3       | Case Study: The Financial Crash of 2008 | 5 hours      |
| 1.4       | Problem Definition                      | 2 hours      |
| 1.5       | Building Blocks of Data Science         | 1 hour       |
| 1.6       | Conclusion                              | 1 hour       |
| **Total** |                                         | **13 hours** |

The course is delivered in ten blocks. Each block will have around 15 to 20
hours of study. You should also set aside some time for working on the two
assignments. Ideally, you will study these over ten weeks rather than try to
cram the entire course in a single week. The assessments are designed to be
cumulative, so it is important that you understand the material in each block
before moving on to the next.

The aim of this week is to demystify the concept of data science and to provide
a basic understanding of the concepts that we will meet throughout the course.

## What This Course Does Not Cover

As a ten-week course, there are some topics closely aligned to data science that
cannot be covered in depth. These include, "Big Data", "Data Engineering", "
Data Governance" and "Machine Learning". These topics will be covered in other
courses in the programme. Despite this, you will see references to these topics
throughout the course. This is to give you an understanding of how they fit into
the wider data science landscape.

## Tools Used in This Course

I'm a firm believer in using "the right tool for the job". In data science,
there are many tools available, from Excel, through to Python and R. The course
does not dictate which tool you use, but if you want to gain some experience in
tools used in industry, I would strongly recommend you try out both Python and
R. Both Python and R have extensive user communities. It's more than likely that
if you experience problems with either, you will find an answer online. You can
try both out without installing anything by using Google's Colab service:
<https://colab.research.google.com>. This should give you a good idea of what
the tools can do, and which may be a good fit for you.

If you are new to Python, I would recommend you start with the
[Python for Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).
If you are new to R, I would recommend you start with the
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book. Tools are discussed in far
greater depth in week [10](../10/10.0.md).

## Activity 1.0.1

_Allow 1 hour_

Data science covers a broad range of careers. Read Appendix G of "A Hands-On
Introduction to Data Science" and consider which of the discussed roles you
would be most interested in. Write a short paragraph on why you are interested
in this role in the forums.
