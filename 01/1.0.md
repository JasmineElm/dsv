# Week 1: Introduction

Welcome to the course.  This course is designed to give you a practical introduction to data science and visualisation.  As a Masters-level course, it is expected that you will be able to work independently and to a high standard.  This course is designed to give you the skills you need to be able to work with data and to present your findings in a clear and compelling way.

The course is delivered in ten blocks.  Ideally students will study these over ten weeks rather than bite the whole thing off in a single week.

## [Week 1](1.1.md)

In week one, we will introduce the subject and give you a flavour of what you can expect.

In week four, we will look at how to manipulate data, and unpack the first assessment.

## [Week 5](../05/5.0.md)

In week five, we will look at hypothesis testing.

## [Week 6](../06/6.0.md)

In week six, we will look at exploratory data analysis.

## [Week 7](../07/7.0.md)

In week seven, we will look at how to visualise data.

## [Week 8](../08/8.0.md)

In week eight, we will look at how to tell stories with data.

## [Week 9](../09/9.0.md)

## [Week 10](../10/10.0.md)

In week ten, we consolidate the learning so far and look at the final assessment.


### First Things First

> Look at the module guide and the assessment briefs. Make sure you understand
> what is expected of you and what you need to do to pass the module. Make sure
> you understand the deadlines and the assessment criteria. Whilst the
> terminology may be unfamiliar at this stage, it should give you an
> understanding of what is required, when. If you have any questions, let your
> tutor know. It is a good idea to get the deadlines in your calendar now, so
> you can plan your time effectively.
