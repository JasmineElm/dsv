# Conclusion

This week we have explored the meaning of data science, the key attributes of a
data scientist, and the types of data data analysis.

As we have seen, data science is a multidisciplinary field that combines domain,
statistical, and computational expertise to extract insights from data. Data
scientists use a variety of tools and techniques to analyse data, including
statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualisation.

Data science could, and indeed should, have played a role in preventing the 2008
financial crisis. By analysing historical data on housing prices, mortgage
defaults, and other economic indicators, data scientists could have built
predictive models to forecast the likelihood of a housing market crash. They
could have developed models to assess the risk of mortgage-backed securities and
other financial products, helping financial institutions understand the
underlying quality of the loans. Data science techniques such as anomaly
detection and network analysis could have been used to detect fraud and identify
systemic risks in the financial system.

depth in **chapter one of A Hands On Introduction to Data Science by Chirag
Shah**. Read this chapter to deepen your understanding of the concepts we have
covered this week.

## Activity 1.6.2 Reflection

_Allow 30 minutes_
