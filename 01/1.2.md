## Data Literacy

Underpinning the ability to work with data, and to make informed decisions based
on data, is a concept known as "data literacy". Data literacy is the ability to
read, work with, analyse, and argue with data. It is a critical skill for the
modern world, and is essential for making informed decisions. Data literacy is
not just about understanding data, it is about understanding the context in
which the data was collected, and being able to interpret and communicate the
findings. Data literacy is essential for anyone working with data, from data
scientists to business analysts to policy makers. It is a skill that can be
learned, and is essential for anyone working with data.

It's worth noting that the audience for our data analysis also need a level of
data literacy. If we are presenting our findings to a non-technical audience, we
need to be able to communicate our findings in a way that is clear and
compelling. This might involve creating visualisations, writing reports, or
giving presentations. It is important to understand the needs of our audience,
and to tailor our communication to meet those needs. There is an implicit need
to help our audience develop their data literacy, so that they can understand
and interpret the data we present to them.

Read chapter 19 of **The State of Open Data: Histories and Horizons** by Tim
Davies and Stephen Walker. This discusses the issues and importance of data
literacy. Consider the following questions:

- How can we define "data literacy"?
- Why is data literacy important?
- How can we improve data literacy?

Data literacy is the ability to correctly interpret and use data. Digital
literacy is a related concept, but it is broader in scope. Digital literacy is
the ability to use digital technologies to find, evaluate, create, and
communicate information.

Data literacy is particularly important for open data analysis. Open data is
often published in a raw format, and may require cleaning and transformation
before it can be analysed. There is no expectation that citizen data scientists
have formal training, but they need an understanding of the core concepts to be
able to access and analyse data. Many providers of open data provide tools and
resources to help citizen data scientists get started, for instance the
[Scottish Government's Open Data Portal](https://www.statistics.gov.scot/).

Data literacy and digital literacy are closely aligned. Digital literacy is the
ability to use digital technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate
information. Data literacy is the ability to correctly interpret and use data.
Both are essential skills for citizen data scientists, as they enable
individuals to access and analyse data for themselves.

Poor digital literacy may mean that data is misinterpreted, or that the wrong
conclusions are drawn. This can have serious consequences, particularly when the
data is used to inform policy or decision-making. Read the article **Effects of
misinformation on COVID-19 individual responses and recommendations for
resilience of disastrous consequences of misinformation** by Baura et al (2020)
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590061720300569> As you
read, consider the following questions:

- What are the key dangers of misinterpreting data?
- How can we avoid these dangers?
- What role does digital literacy play in avoiding these dangers?

## Efforts and Activities to Improve Data Literacy

The above example highlights the importance of data literacy in the modern world. Critics warn that that the difference between the prospects of people with high and low levels of data literacy is likely to increase in the future . The UK Government has identified the "digital gap" as a key issue, and has launched a number of initiatives to improve digital literacy. These include the Digital Skills Partnership, which aims to improve digital skills across the UK, and the Digital Skills Innovation Fund, which provides funding for projects that aim to improve digital skills.
