## Data Literacy

Underpinning the ability to work with data, and to make informed decisions based on data, is a concept known
as "data literacy". Data literacy is the ability to read, work with, analyse,
and argue with data. It is a critical skill for the modern world, and is
essential for making informed decisions. Data literacy is not just about
understanding data, it is about understanding the context in which the data was
collected, and being able to interpret and communicate the findings. Data
literacy is essential for anyone working with data, from data scientists to
business analysts to policy makers. It is a skill that can be learned, and is
essential for anyone working with data.

It's worth noting that the audience for our data analysis also need a level of
data literacy. If we are presenting our findings to a non-technical audience, we
need to be able to communicate our findings in a way that is clear and
compelling. This might involve creating visualisations, writing reports, or
giving presentations. It is important to understand the needs of our audience,
and to tailor our communication to meet those needs. There is an implicit need
to help our audience develop their data literacy, so that they can understand
and interpret the data we present to them.
