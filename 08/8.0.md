# Week 8: Storytelling with Data

In this week, we will focus on developing narratives from data. Data
storytelling is a key skill for analysts and data scientists, as it helps to
communicate complex insights in a clear and compelling way. We will explore the
key elements of data storytelling, including identifying the audience,
structuring the narrative, and using visualisation to support the story. We will
also discuss the importance of ethical considerations in data storytelling and
how to ensure that your narrative is accurate and unbiased.

The data can tell you _what_ is important, storytelling communicates _why_ it is
important. Data storytelling is the process of creating a narrative around the
data to communicate insights and findings to stakeholders. Data storytelling is
the reason that the seminal visualisations from Maury, Nightingale, and Snow are
still remembered today. They didn't just present data, they told a story with
it. Through their storytelling, real change was made. The _value_ of data
storytelling is in the _action_ it inspires.

A key part of data storytelling is understanding your audience. Good story
telling is not just about the story, it is about the audience. You need to know
who you are talking to, what they care about, and what they need to know.
Instead of presenting what we _think_ is important, we need to present what _is_
important to the audience. We can only do this by listening to them, and
understanding their needs. This is why data storytelling is a _two-way_ process.
It is not just about presenting data, it is about _engaging_ with the audience,
and _listening_ to their needs.

## Activity 8.0.1

_Allow 1 hour_

Cole Nussbaummer Knaflic, author of _Storytelling with Data_, has a great
"Google Talks" talk on the subject. Watch the video and take notes on the key
points she makes about data storytelling.

## Examples of Data Storytelling

Data storytelling can take many forms, from simple charts and graphs to
interactive dashboards and multimedia presentations. Unlike the visualisation
methods we have encountered so far, data storytelling is not just about
presenting the data, it is about _communicating_ the data. This means that we
need to develop a narrative that explains the data, and makes it _meaningful_ to
the audience. This is why data storytelling is often used in journalism,
marketing, and other fields where the goal is to _persuade_ or _inform_ the
audience. Data storytelling is a powerful tool for _engaging_ with the audience,
and _inspiring_ them to take action.

The best data stories are often found in data journalism. Data journalism is an
emerging field that combines traditional journalism with data analysis and
visualisation. Data journalists use data to tell stories, uncover trends, and
hold institutions to account. Data journalism is a powerful tool for
_transparency_ and _accountability_, as it allows journalists to present the
facts in a clear and compelling way. At its' core, data journalism focusses on
_engagement_, journalists to present complex information in a way that is easy
to understand and _share_. Typically, this journalism will hope to inspire
change, or at least lay the groundwork for conversations that will lead to
change.

## Activity 8.0.2

_Allow 30 minutes_

What examples of data storytelling have you encountered in the past? Try to
think about

- What made them compelling?
- how the story was expressed through the visualisation
- Whether they rely on a high level of digital literacy or not
- How could you adopt these techniques in your own work?

### Discussion

When I think of good data storytelling, I think of the UK Government's COVID-19
briefings. The briefings were a daily event during the height of the pandemic,
and they were a masterclass in data storytelling. The briefings were a mix of
data, charts, and graphs, but they were also a compelling narrative that told
the story of the pandemic in the UK. The briefings were clear, concise, and easy
to understand, and were tailored to meet the needs of viewers with lower digital
literacy without patronising them. The briefings were also interactive, with the
presenters taking questions from the audience and responding to them in
real-time. The briefings were carefully tailored to present precise facts,
alongside an authoritative narrative that explained what they meant, and why
they were important. The events managed to balance empathy with authority; death
rates were presented sensitively and with respect, while the need for action was
made clear. The government maintain a
[Covid-19 dashboard](https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/), which I suspect most
viewers will be able to understand and interpret, years after the pandemic has
passed.

## Narrative and "Factfulness"

"Factfulness" is a term used by Hans Rosling. He uses it to describe the process
of understanding the world as it is, rather than as we _think_ it is. It is a
way of thinking that is based on _evidence_ and _reason_, rather than _emotion_
and _prejudice_. The best data story telling can change our fundamental
(mis)understanding of the world. It can challenge our assumptions, and make us
see the world in a new light. This is the power of data storytelling, and it is
why it is so important to get it right.

When we talk about "story telling", we may think of fiction. Telling the most
vibrant story by bending, or making up facts. For Data Storytelling, we need to
be more careful. We need to be _truthful_ and _accurate_. We have discussed
ethics in data science in week 5, and we need to apply the same principles here.
There may be a temptation to make the "data fit the story", rather than the
other way around. Though this could make the narrative more compelling, it is
unethical, and once discovered, will undermine the credibility of both story and
storyteller. There is an additional trap here, in that the data may be
_accurate_, but the _narrative_ may be misleading. This is a common problem in
the media, where a story is presented in a way that is technically true, but
gives a misleading impression. This is why it is important to consider the
_context_ of the data, and to ensure that the narrative is _balanced_ and
_fair_.

## Activity 8.0.3

_Allow 30 minutes_

Hans Rosling's TED talk "The Best Stats You've Ever Seen" is a great example of
using humour and storytelling to communicate complex data. Watch the video and
take notes on the key points he makes about data storytelling.

## Spurious correlations

Rosling introduces an important concept in his talk; "spurious correlations". He
uses it to comedic effect, but it is a common trap in data analysis. A spurious
correlation is a relationship between two variables that is not _causal_. For
example, there may be a strong correlation between the number of pirates in the
world and global warming. This is not because pirates _cause_ global warming or
vice-versa. At best one could try to argue that _the boats used by pirates_ may
have contributed to global warming, but this is a stretch. There are numerous
examples of spurious correlations in the media, such as the "relationship
between Dark Chocolate and Nobel Laureates" as reported by
[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2012/10/10/chocolate-and-nobel-prizes-linked-in-study/)
Whilst the two sets of data are both accurate, there is no _causal_ relationship
between the two. The article that Forbes refers to is a
[satirical piece](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMon1211064) that
highlights the dangers of drawing conclusions from data that are not correlated.
It's possible that Forbes was "in on the joke", but the report was picked up
worldwide, and the "relationship" between chocolate and Nobel prizes was widely
reported. For readers with limited digital literacy, this was misleading, and
could have led to the conclusion that eating chocolate would make them more
likely to win a Nobel prize. There is a good write up of this on the
[The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/what-a-link-between-chocolate-and-nobel-prizes-reveals-about-our-trust-in-scientists-148570)]

It is important to be aware of spurious correlations when creating data stories
in particular. You may find yourself wanting to support your claims with
additional data. The best way to avoid this trap is to be _sceptical_ of the
data, and to _test_ the conclusions you draw from it. This is where the
scientific method comes in. By testing your conclusions, you can ensure that
they are _valid_ and _reliable_.

## Activity 8.0.4

_Allow 30 minutes_

There is a website dedicated to drawing spurious correlations;
[Spurious Correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) Spend
soe time looking at the examples on the site, and consider how you could use
these examples to illustrate the dangers of drawing conclusions from data that
are not correlated.
