# Markdown for Data Science

If we are using notebooks in Python or R, we will likely be documenting our
process in markdown. Markdown makes it easy to created structured documents
without having to learn the complex syntax of HTML or LaTeX. Though we cannot
(easily) style our documents as we can with HTML Word, the syntax is so light
that we only need to worry about the content. Markdown is a plain text format,
which means that it can be written in any text editor, and can be easily read by
humans.

## What is Markdown?

The original markdown syntax was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz
in 2004. Gruber wanted a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and
write. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and to be converted to HTML.
Markdown is often used to write documentation, README files, and other types of
text that need to be formatted in a structured way. Markdown files are easy to
read "raw", but can be rendered into a more visually appealing format using a
markdown processor. A markdown processor is a program that takes a markdown file
as input, converts it to html, and potentially other formats. Jupyter and
RStudio both have built-in markdown processors that allow you to view your
markdown files as they will appear when rendered.

## Markdown Syntax

Markdown uses a simple syntax to format text. Here are some of the most common
elements of markdown syntax:

| Element         | Syntax                                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Headers         | `# Header 1`<br>`## Header 2`<br>`### Header 3`     |
| Emphasis        | `*italic*`<br>`**bold**`                            |
| ordered Lists   | `1. item 1`<br>`2. item 2`                          |
| unordered list  | `* item 1`<br>`* item 2`                            |
| Links           | `[link text](url)`                                  |
| Images          | `![alt text](url)`                                  |
| Code            | `` `code` ``<br>` ```syntax`<br>`code block`<br>``` |
| Blockquotes     | `> blockquote`                                      |
| Horizontal rule | `---`                                               |
| Paragrah        | `text separated by`<br><br>`two carriage returns`   |

### Tables

Tables are not part of the original markdown syntax, but are supported by many
markdown processors, including Jupyter and RStudio. There are number of
different ways to create tables in markdown, but the most common is to use a
simple syntax that uses pipes (`|`) to separate columns, and hyphens (`-`) to
separate the header row from the content rows. Here is an example of a simple
table in markdown:

```markdown
| Column 1     | Column 2     | Column 3     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |
```

We can align content in the columns by using colons (`:`) in the header row. For
example, to align the content in the first column to the left, the content in
the second column to the center, and the content in the third column to the
right, we would use the following syntax:

```markdown
| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Left         |     Center     |         Right |
| Left         |     Center     |         Right |
```

### Escaping Characters

If you want to include a character that has a special meaning in markdown, you
can escape it by putting a backslash (`\`) in front of it. For example, to
include an asterisk (`*`) in your text without it being interpreted as an
emphasis marker, you would write `\*` instead of `*`.

## Markdown Dialects

The original specification of markdown is quite spartan and does not include
things such as footnotes, checkboxes, or strikethrough text. To address this,
several different dialects of markdown have been created that add additional
features to the original syntax. Some of the most popular markdown dialects
include:

- GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM): A dialect of markdown that is used on GitHub.
  GFM adds several features, such as task lists, tables, and syntax highlighting
  for code blocks. This is used in Jupyter
- R Markdown: A dialect of markdown that is used in RStudio

There are many others, such as `commonMark`, `Pandoc`, and `kramdown`. Though
these dialects can offer additional features, the basic syntax of markdown is
common across all of them. This means that you can write markdown files that are
compatible with multiple markdown processors, and that will render correctly in
different environments. A good rule of thumb is to stick to the basic markdown
syntax, and avoid using features that are specific to a particular dialect. If
you find a feature that you need such as MathJax, you can always write that in
HTML.

## Activity 10.0.1.1: Review the Markdown syntax

_Allow 30 minutes_

Open the Python notebook
[Markdown_basics](../Activities/10/10.0.1.1/Markdown_Basics.ipynb) and review
the markdown syntax. Save the notebook, and then render it to see how the
markdown is displayed. Use the export options to save it as an HTML file, and
open the HTML file in a web browser to see how it is displayed.

Try to use create each of the following elements in the notebook:

- Headers
- Emphasis
- Lists
- Links
- Images
- Codebocks

## Conclusion

Markdown is an incredibly simple way of formatting text. Whilst we have
discussed the basics here with a view to using markdown within Juypter and R
notebooks, the applications are much wider. Projects such as Pandoc, Jekyll and
Quarto all use markdown as a basis for creating documents, websites and books.
It is a skill that is worth learning and will be useful in many different
contexts.
