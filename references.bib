Foreword CRISP-DM was conceived in late 1996 by three " veterans " of the young and immature data mining market. DaimlerChrysler (then Daimler-Benz) was already experienced, ahead of most industrial and commercial organizations, in applying data mining in its business operations. SPSS (then ISL) had been providing services based on data mining since 1990 and had launched the first commercial data mining workbench -- Clementine -- in 1994. NCR, as part of its aim to deliver added value to its Teradata data warehouse customers, had established teams of data mining consultants and technology specialists to service its clients' requirements. At that time, early market interest in data mining was showing signs of exploding into widespread uptake. This was both exciting and terrifying. All of us had developed our approaches to data mining as we went along. Were we doing it right? Was every new adopter of data mining going to have to learn, as we had initially, by trial and error? And from a supplier's perspective, how could we demonstrate to prospective customers that data mining was sufficiently mature to be adopted as a key part of their business processes? A standard process model, we reasoned, non-proprietary and freely available, would address these issues for us and for all practitioners. A year later we had formed a consortium, invented an acronym (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), obtained funding from the European Commission and begun to set out our initial ideas. As CRISP-DM was intended to be industry-, tool-and application-neutral, we knew we had to get input from as wide a range as possible of practitioners and others (such as data warehouse vendors and management consultancies) with a vested interest in data mining. We did this by creating the CRISP-DM Special Interest Group (" The SIG " , as it became known). We launched the SIG by broadcasting an invitation to interested parties to join us in Amsterdam for a day-long {\dots}},

Indeed, Greylock Partners, the VC firm that backed Facebook and LinkedIn, is so worried about the shortage of data scientists that it has a recruiting team dedicated to channeling them to the businesses in its portfolio. Data scientists are the key to realizing the opportunities presented by big data. They bring structure to it, find compelling patterns in it, and advise executives on the implications for products, processes, and decisions. They find the story buried in the data and communicate it. And they don't just deliver reports: They get at the questions at the heart of problems and devise creative approaches to them. One data scientist who was studying a fraud problem, for example, realized it was analogous to a type of DNA sequencing problem. Bringing those disparate worlds together, he crafted a solution that dramatically reduced fraud losses. In this article, Harvard Business School's Davenport and Greylock's Patil take a deep dive on what organizations need to know about data scientists: where to look for them, how to attract and develop them, and how to spot a great one.},

Also included is some background information on places, names and terms used in the story. The book features the original drawings from the first publication.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of global aviation operations has made its negative environmental impact an international concern. Accurate modeling of aircraft fuel burn, emissions, and noise is the prerequisite for informing new operational procedures, technologies, and policies towards a more sustainable future of aviation. In the past decade, due to the advances in big data technologies and effective algorithms, the transformative data-driven analysis has begun to play a substantial role in aviation environmental impact analysis. The integration of statistical and machine learning methods in the workflow has made such analysis more efficient and accurate. Through summarizing and classifying the representative works in this intersection area, this survey paper aims to extract prevailing research trends and suggest research opportunities for the future. The methodology overview section presents a comprehensive development process and landscape of statistical and machine learning methods for applied researchers. In the main section, relevant works in the literature are organized into seven application themes: data reduction, efficient computation, predictive modeling, uncertainty quantification, pattern discovery, verification and validation, and infrastructure and tools. Each theme contains background information, in-depth discussion, and a summary of representative works. The paper concludes with the proposal of five future opportunities for this research area.},

Written in David's signature friendly and humorous style, this book discusses in detail the essential steps performed in every production data science or data analysis pipeline and prepares you for data visualization and modeling results. The book dives into the practical application of tools and techniques needed for data ingestion, anomaly detection, value imputation, and feature engineering. It also offers long-form exercises at the end of each chapter to practice the skills acquired. You will begin by looking at data ingestion of data formats such as JSON, CSV, SQL RDBMSes, HDF5, NoSQL databases, files in image formats, and binary serialized data structures. Further, the book provides numerous example data sets and data files, which are available for download and independent exploration. Moving on from formats, you will impute missing values, detect unreliable data and statistical anomalies, and generate synthetic features that are necessary for successful data analysis and visualization goals. By the end of this book, you will have acquired a firm understanding of the data cleaning process necessary to perform real-world data science and machine learning tasks. What you will learn How to think carefully about your data and ask the right questions Identify problem data pertaining to individual data points Detect problem data in the systematic "shape" of the data Remediate data integrity and hygiene problems Prepare data for analytic and machine learning tasks Impute values into missing or unreliable data Generate synthetic features that are more amenable to data science, data analysis, or visualization goals.

Land use and land cover perspectives are both important and need to be described. Land use describes the social and economic intent for which land is used, while land cover describes the vegetation, exposed land surfaces, water, and artificial structures covering the land surface at a given time. The choice of one land classification system over another depends on several factors, including the specific resource question being addressed, the data available to answer the question, the time frame of the analysis, and the spatial extent of the study area.},

It requires you to develop a data culture that involves people throughout the organization. In this O'Reilly report, DJ Patil and Hilary Mason outline the steps you need to take if your company is to be truly data-driven---including the questions you should ask and the methods you should adopt.You'll not only learn examples of how Google, LinkedIn, and Facebook use their data, but also how Walmart, UPS, and other organizations took advantage of this resource long before the advent of Big Data. No matter how you approach it, building a data culture is the key to success in the 21st century.You'll explore:Data scientist skills---and why every company needs a SpockHow the benefits of giving company-wide access to data outweigh the costsWhy data-driven organizations use the scientific method to explore and solve data problemsKey questions to help you develop a research-specific process for tackling important issuesWhat to consider when assembling your data teamDeveloping processes to keep your data team (and company) engagedChoosing technologies that are powerful, support teamwork, and easy to use and learn},

  abstract = {Predicting forced displacement is an important undertaking of many humanitarian aid agencies, which must anticipate flows in advance in order to provide vulnerable refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) with shelter, food, and medical care. While there is a growing interest in using machine learning to better anticipate future arrivals, there is little standardized knowledge on how to predict refugee and IDP flows in practice. Researchers and humanitarian officers are confronted with the need to make decisions about how to structure their datasets and how to fit their problem to predictive analytics approaches, and they must choose from a variety of modeling options. Most of the time, these decisions are made without an understanding of the full range of options that could be considered, and using methodologies that have primarily been applied in different contexts -- and with different goals -- as opportunistic references. In this work, we attempt to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of this emerging field of research by providing a systematic model-agnostic framework, adapted to the use of big data sources, for structuring the prediction problem. As we do so, we highlight existing work on predicting refugee and IDP flows. We also draw on our own experience building models to predict forced displacement in Somalia, in order to illustrate the choices facing modelers and point to open research questions that may be used to guide future work.},

We give an overview of the research focus, current methodologies, best practices and possible gaps in conducting the six phases of CRISP-DM. The main findings are that CRISP-DM is still a de-factor standard in data mining, but there are challenges since the most studies do not foresee a deployment phase. The contribution of our paper is to identify best practices and process phases in which data mining analysts can be better supported. Further contribution is a template for structuring and releasing CRISP-DM studies.},

Yet from the financial crisis to ecological disasters, we routinely fail to foresee hugely significant events, often at great cost to society. The rise of 'big data' has the potential to help us predict the future, yet much of it is misleading, useless or distracting.In The Signal and the Noise, the New York Times political forecaster Nate Silver, who accurately predicted the results of every state in the 2012 US election, reveals how we can all develop better foresight in an uncertain world. From the stock market to the poker table, from earthquakes to the economy, he takes us on an enthralling insider's tour of the high-stakes world of forecasting, showing how we can all learn to detect the true signals amid a noise of data.

David Spiegelhalter reveals the answers to these and many other questions - questions that can only be addressed using statistical science.Statistics has played a leading role in our scientific understanding of the world for centuries, yet we are all familiar with the way statistical claims can be sensationalised, particularly in the media. In the age of big data, as data science becomes established as a discipline, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever. In The Art of Statistics, David Spiegelhalter guides the reader through the essential principles we need in order to derive knowledge from data. Drawing on real world problems to introduce conceptual issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether serial killer Harold Shipman could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial.

In many ways this has improved our lives, yet, we as individuals do not benefit from this wealth of data as much as we could. Moreover, whether it is a bank evaluating our credit worthiness, an insurance company determining our risk level, or a potential employer deciding whether we get a job, it is likely that this data will be used against us rather than for us. In Data for the People, Andreas Weigend draws on his years as a consultant for commerce, education, healthcare, travel and finance companies to outline how Big Data can work better for all of us. As of today, how much we benefit from Big Data depends on how closely the interests of big companies align with our own. Too often, outdated standards of control and privacy force us into unfair contracts with data companies, but it doesn't have to be this way. Weigend makes a powerful argument that we need to take control of how our data is used to actually make it work for us. Only then can we the people get back more from Big Data than we give it. Big Data is here to stay. Now is the time to find out how we can be empowered by it.},

Technologies that were meant to liberate us have deepened inequality and stoked divisions. Tech companies gather our information online and sell it to the highest bidder, whether government or retailer. Profits now depend not only on predicting our behaviour but modifying it too. How will this fusion of capitalism and the digital shape our values and define our future? Shoshana Zuboff shows that we are at a crossroads. We still have the power to decide what kind of world we want to live in, and what we decide now will shape the rest of the century. Our choices: allow technology to enrich the few and impoverish the many, or harness it and distribute its benefits.The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a deeply-reasoned examination of the threat of unprecedented power free from democratic oversight. As it explores this new capitalism's impact on society, politics, business, and technology, it exposes the struggles that will decide both the next chapter of capitalism and the meaning of information civilization. Most critically, it shows how we can protect ourselves and our communities and ensure we are the masters of the digital rather than its slaves.},
