# Data Cleansing

> Cleaning the data is often the most taxing part of data science, and is

Data cleansing is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt
or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database. It refers to
identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate, irrelevant, or missing parts of
the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.
Data cleansing is an essential part of data management and is a crucial step in
data analysis. In databases, a common practice is to develop solutions to ensure
captured data is clean before it is written to the database. This is often done
through the use of constraints and triggers.
