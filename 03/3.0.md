# Creating Your Own Datasets

Last week we looked at how to find and evaluate existing datasets. This week we
will look at how to create your own datasets using tools such as APIs, SQL, and
web scraping. By the end of this week, you will be able to create your own
datasets for use in your data science projects.

This week will be more technical than the previous weeks. If you are not
familiar with programming, you may find some of the concepts challenging. Please
try to dedicate the time to follow the activities and complete the exercises. If
you get stuck, please ask for help in the forums.

## How to use your time this week

The learning this week intends to be more practical than theoretical. You will
be using tools and techniques to create your own datasets. Although there will
be some readings to bolster this learning, the majority of your time should be
spent on the activities and exercises.
