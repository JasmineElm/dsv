# Data Cleansing

Data cleansing is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database. It refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate, irrelevant, or missing parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data. Data cleansing is an essential part of data management and is a crucial step in data analysis.  In databases, a common practice is to develop solutions to ensure captured data is clean before it is written to the database. This is often done through the use of constraints and triggers.
