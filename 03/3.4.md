# Webscraping

Webscraping is the process of automatically retrieving information from websites.
Whilst APIs are a cleaner and more reliable way to access data from websites,
not all websites provide APIs. In these cases, webscraping can be a useful
alternative. However, webscraping can be more fragile than using an API, as it
relies on the structure of the website remaining consistent. If the website
changes its structure, the webscraping code may break. Similarly, some websites
will block webscraping attempts either using javascript or by detecting unusual
traffic patterns. In these cases, it's worth asking "can I find this information
elsewhere?" before attempting to scrape the website. Irresponsible webscraping
can also put a strain on the website's servers, so it is important to be
respectful of the website's terms of service and use webscraping responsibly.

There are many tools and
libraries available for webscraping, including `BeautifulSoup` in Python,
`rvest` in R, and `powerquery` in Excel.
