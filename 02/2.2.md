## Evaluating Datasets

You may have come across the "PROMPT" criteria for evaluating texts. The PROMPT
criteria are a set of questions that can be used to evaluate the quality of a
text. The PROMPT criteria are:

- **Presentation**
  - Is the information presented clearly?
  - Is the language appropriate?
  - Is it succinct?
  - Can I understand it?
- **Relevance**
  - Does this information match my needs right now?
  - What is it mostly about?
- **Objectivity**
  - Is there bias in what you are reading?
  - Might the author/s have any hidden agendas? Have they been selective with
    their evidence?
  - Is the language used emotive?
  - Are opinions expressed?
  - Are there sponsors?
  - What are they selling? A particular product, a corporate view?
  - Is there contribution from different viewpoints by diverse authors to
    provide a balanced overview?
  - Are you selecting sources which confirm your own biases or seeking a broad
    range of perspectives on an issue?
- **Method**
  - Is it clear how any research was carried out?
  - How was data gathered?
  - If statistical data is presented, what is this based on?
  - Do researchers address any differences in outcomes between groups (e.g.,
    ethnic/racial groups)?
  - Were the methods appropriate, rigorous, etc.?
- **Provenance**
  - Is it clear who produced this information?
  - Where does it come from? Whose opinions are these?
  - Do you trust this source of information?
  - Are there references/citations that lead to further reading, and are they
    trustworthy sources?
- **Timeliness**
  - When was it produced or published? Do any of the sources reinforce
    stereotypes or represent other outdated views?
  - Is it current?
  - Has the climate/situation changed since this information was made available?
  - Is it still up to date?

## Data Quality

Data quality is a measure of how well data meets the needs of its users. Data quality is important because it affects the accuracy and reliability of the insights that can be drawn from the data. Poor data quality can lead to incorrect conclusions and poor decision-making. There are many factors that can affect data quality, including:
+ **Accuracy**: How accurate is the data? Does it contain errors or inconsistencies?
+ **Completeness**: Is the data complete? Are there missing values or fields?
+ **Consistency**: Is the data consistent? Are there discrepancies between different sources of data?
+ **Timeliness**: Is the data up-to-date? Is it relevant to the current situation?
+ **Relevance**: Is the data relevant to the problem you are trying to solve?

Data quality can be assessed using a variety of techniques, including data profiling, data cleansing, and data validation. Data profiling involves analysing the data to identify patterns, anomalies, and inconsistencies. Data cleansing involves correcting errors, removing duplicates, and filling in missing values. Data validation involves checking the data against predefined rules or constraints to ensure that it meets the required quality standards.

#### Discussion

I was recently working on a project to understand the use of sex (biological) and gender (identified by the individual) in an organisation. The dataset I was working with had a field for both sets, but had only collected gender information in the past couple of years. This meant that the dataset was incomplete and inconsistent. Exacerbating this, there were two additional issues:
1. Gender information was being backfilled into the `sex` field.  If someone identified as male, both their gender and sex were recorded as male.  This meant that the data was not only incomplete, but also inaccurate.
2. whilst both fields were codified, the organisation did not have definitions for the terms `sex` and `gender`, so it was unclear what the data was actually representing.


## Data _Meaning_

If we are lucky, we may also be able to access a data dictionary. A data dictionary is a document that provides detailed information about the data in a dataset. A data dictionary typically includes the following information:
