# Week 2: Finding and Evaluating Datasets

Welcome to the second week of the course. This week we will look at how to find, evaluate and use existing datasets. We will also look at how to extract data from various sources. By the end of this week, you will be able to identify and evaluate datasets for use in your data science projects.

## Learning Outcomes

## How to use your time this week

This week you should spend approximately 3 hours studying the materials, and 3 hours working on the activities. The activities this week will involve finding and evaluating datasets, and extracting data from various sources. You will also have the opportunity to discuss your findings with your peers.


# Identifying datasets

Data Scientists often have to choose between using existing datasets or
collecting their own data. This week we will look at how to find and evaluate
existing datasets.

## What is a dataset?

Before we start looking for datasets, it is important to understand what a data
set is. A dataset is a collection of data that is organised in a structured way.
Datasets can be stored in a variety of formats, including spreadsheets,
databases, and text files. They can contain a wide range of data types,
including numbers, text, images, and more.

Datasets can be divided into two main types: structured and unstructured.
Structured datasets are highly organised and can be easily searched and
analysed. Unstructured datasets are less organised and can be more difficult to
search and analyse.

## Data Types

The data we work with may be categorised into different types. The type of data
we are working with will determine the methods we use to analyse it. Here are
some common data types:

| Data type   | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Categorical | Data that can be divided into categories. |
| Numerical   | Data that consists of numbers.            |
| Ordinal     | Data that can be ordered.                 |
| Text        | Data that consists of text.               |
| Image       | Data that consists of images.             |
| Time series | Data that is collected over time.         |

Within each of these types, there are many different subtypes. For example,
numerical data can be further divided into discrete and continuous data. Mixing
different data types can lead to problems when analysing the data, so it is
important to understand the different types of data that you are working with.

On a purely functional level, we are interested in `datatypes`. Are we looking
at a number, date or string. We saw the impact of the _wrong_ datatype in the
demonstration in Week 1. Most modelling or analysis tools will have an extended
range of datatypes, you should find that most have a combination of the
following

| Common programming name | Description                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| int                     | Integer, a whole number                                   |
| float                   | Floating point number, a number with a decimal point      |
| str                     | String, a sequence of characters                          |
| bool                    | Boolean, a binary value, either True or False             |
| datetime                | Date and time                                             |
| blob                    | Binary Large Object, a large binary object e.g., an image |

## How data is stored

Data is typically stored in either **structured** or **unstructured** formats.  In structured data, the data is organised in a way that makes it easy to search and analyse.
