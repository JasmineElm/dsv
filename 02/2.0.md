# Week 2: Finding and Evaluating Datasets

Welcome to the second week of the course. Data Scientists often have to choose
between using existing datasets or collecting their own data. This week we will
look at how to find and evaluate existing datasets. We will also look at how to
extract data from various sources. By the end of this week, you will be able to
identify and evaluate datasets for use in your data science projects.

## How to use your time this week

This week you should spend approximately two hours studying each section, and a
further three hours reading round the concepts introduced. The activities this
week will involve finding and evaluating datasets, and extracting data from
various sources. You will also have the opportunity to discuss your findings
with your peers.

# Identifying datasets

## What is a dataset?

We've used the term a few times in the course already, but before we move onto
looking for datasets, it is important to understand what we mean when we talk
about a "dataset".

A dataset is a collection of data that is organised in a structured way.
Datasets can be stored in a variety of formats, including spreadsheets,
databases, and text files. They can contain a wide range of data types,
including numbers, text, images, and more.

Datasets can be divided into two main types: structured and unstructured.
Structured datasets are highly organised and can be easily searched and
analysed. Unstructured datasets are less organised and can be more difficult to
search and analyse.

## Data Types

The data we work with may be categorised into different types. The type of data
we are working with will determine the methods we use to analyse it. Here are
some common data types:

| Data type   | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Categorical | Data that can be divided into categories. |
| Numerical   | Data that consists of numbers.            |
| Ordinal     | Data that can be ordered.                 |
| Text        | Data that consists of text.               |
| Image       | Data that consists of images.             |
| Time series | Data that is collected over time.         |

Within each of these types, there are many different subtypes. For example,
numerical data can be further divided into discrete and continuous data. Mixing
different data types can lead to problems when analysing the data, so it is
important to understand the different types of data that you are working with.

On a purely functional level, we are interested in `datatypes`. Are we looking
at a number, date or string. We saw the impact of the _wrong_ datatype in the
demonstration in Week 1. Most modelling or analysis tools will have an extended
range of datatypes, you should find that most have a combination of the
following

| Common programming name | Description                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| int                     | Integer, a whole number                                   |
| float                   | Floating point number, a number with a decimal point      |
| str                     | String, a sequence of characters                          |
| bool                    | Boolean, a binary value, either True or False             |
| datetime                | Date and time                                             |
| blob                    | Binary Large Object, a large binary object e.g., an image |

## How data is stored

Data is typically stored in either **structured** or **unstructured** formats.
In structured data, the data is organised in a way that makes it easy to search
and analyse. Structured data is typically stored in databases or spreadsheets.
Unstructured data, on the other hand, is not organised in a structured way and
can be more difficult to search and analyse. Examples of unstructured data
include text documents, images, and videos. There is a third, increasingly
common type of data-storage called **semi-structured** data. Semi-structured
data is data that does not fit neatly into a structured format but has some
organisational properties. Examples of semi-structured data include JSON and XML
files. You will find semi-structured data in web APIs and NoSQL databases.

## Activity 2.0.1

_Allow 1 hour_ Read **Chapter 2 of A Hands on Introduction to Data Science by
Chirag Shah**. This chapter covers the following topics:

- Data Types
- Data Collections
- Data Pre-Processing

Data Types are the foundation of data science. Understanding the different types
of data that you will encounter is essential to being able to work with it. Data
Collections are the different ways that data can be stored and accessed. Data
Pre-Processing is the process of cleaning and preparing data for analysis. This
is an essential step in the data science process, as the quality of the data
will affect the accuracy and reliability of the insights that can be drawn from
it.
