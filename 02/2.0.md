# Identifying datasets

Data Scientists often have to choose between using existing datasets or
collecting their own data. This week we will look at how to find and evaluate
existing datasets.

## What is a dataset?

Before we start looking for datasets, it is important to understand what a data set is. A dataset is a collection of data that is organised in a structured way. Datasets can be stored in a variety of formats, including spreadsheets, databases, and text files. They can contain a wide range of data types, including numbers, text, images, and more.

Datasets can be divided into two main types: structured and unstructured. Structured datasets are highly organised and can be easily searched and analysed. Unstructured datasets are less organised and can be more difficult to search and analyse.

## Data-types

In the demonstration in Week 1, we briefly looked at the different types of data that can be collected. These include:

| Data type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Categorical | Data that can be divided into categories. |
| Numerical | Data that consists of numbers. |
| Ordinal | Data that can be ordered. |
| Text | Data that consists of text. |
| Image | Data that consists of images. |
| Time series | Data that is collected over time. |

On a macro level, datasets can be divided into two main types: structured and unstructured. Structured datasets are highly organised and can be easily searched and analysed. Unstructured datasets are less organised and can be more difficult to search and analyse.
