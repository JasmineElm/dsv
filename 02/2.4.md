# 2.4: Conclusion

This week, we covered the basics of finding and evaluating datasets. We looked
at the Open Data movement and how it has made vast amounts of data available to
the public. We explored the different types of datasets available online, from
cities and regions to countries, healthcare, finance, climate, and research. We
also discussed the rise of citizen data science and how individuals from a wide
range of backgrounds are using data science techniques to analyse data and tell
stories.
