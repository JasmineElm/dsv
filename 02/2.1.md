# Finding Datasets

In an increasingly data-driven world, the ability to find and work with data is
a critical skill. Data is the foundation of data science, and the quality of the
data that you work with will affect the accuracy and reliability of the insights
that you can draw from it. In this section, we will look at how to find and
evaluate datasets.

Over the past decade, there has been an "Open Data" movement. Governments,
organisations, and individuals have made vast amounts of data available to the
public. Open data serves many purposes, from increasing transparency and
accountability to enabling innovation and economic growth. Governments can use
Open data as a proxy for democracy, as it allows citizens to hold their
governments accountable. Open data can also be used to drive innovation and
economic growth, as it provides a valuable resource for entrepreneurs and
businesses to build new products and services. Without the Open Data movement,
many of the data-driven services that we take for granted today would not exist.
For instance without mapping data

This data can be used for a wide range of purposes, from research and analysis
to building applications and services. There are many sources of open data
available online, including:

### Cities / Regions

- [Open Data Philly](https://opendataphilly.org/)
- [New York City](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
- [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/)

### Countries

- [United States](https://www.data.gov/)
- [United Kingdom](https://data.gov.uk/)
- [India](https://data.gov.in/)

### Healthcare

- [Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html)
- [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information)
- [WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho)

### Finance

- [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/)
- [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/en/Data)
- [Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)

### Climate

- [National Centres for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access)
- [National Space and Aeronautics Administration](https://data.nasa.gov/)
- [UK Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/climate-monitoring)

### Research

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

There are also search engines that can help you find datasets, such as
[Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/).

## Activity 2.1.1

_Allow 1 hour_

Search for a dataset that interests you. You can use one of the sources listed
above, or search for a dataset on a topic that interests you. Spend some time
exploring the dataset, and write a brief summary of what you found. You may want
to consider the following questions:

- What is the dataset about?
- What kind of data does it contain?
- What format is the data in?
- Are there any restrictions or limitations?
- What are some potential uses for the data?

### Discussion

I was interested in the growth of Broadband in India. I found a dataset on the
[Indian Government's Open Data Portal](https://visualize.data.gov.in/?inst=ae965f52-015d-47f6-a6ca-ada4c275970b)
that contains information on the number of broadband subscribers in India. The
dataset itself is overly simple; it contains only two columns: the year and the
number of subscribers. The data is in a simple CSV format, and there are no
restrictions on its use. The data could be used to track the growth of broadband
in India over time, and to identify trends and patterns in broadband adoption.
It is likely that to gain any real insight, the data would need to be combined
with other datasets, such as population data, the growth of telecommunications
infrastructure, and the availability of broadband services. - it is possible
that in India, Wired broadband has been superseded by mobile broadband, and this
dataset would not capture that.

## Activity 2.1.2

_Allow 1 hour_

Using the dataset you found in Activity 2.1.1, import it into the data analysis
too of your choice and perform some basic exploratory data analysis. You may
want to consider the following questions:

- Is the dataset complete?
  - if not, what is missing?
- Are there any errors or inconsistencies in the data?
- What are the key features of the data?
- Are there any patterns or trends in the data?

## Open Data Analysis

Alongside the growth of Open Data, there has been an explosion of citizen data
science. Citizen data scientists are individuals who use data science techniques
to analyse data, but who may not have a formal background in data science.
Citizen data scientists come from a wide range of backgrounds, from journalism
to public policy to business. They use data science techniques to answer
questions, solve problems, and tell stories. Citizen data science is a powerful
tool for increasing transparency and accountability, as it allows individuals to
analyse data for themselves and draw their own conclusions. Citizen data science
is also a valuable resource for innovation and economic growth, as it enables
individuals to build new products and services using data.

## Activity 2.1.3

_Allow 1 hour_

Read Chapter four of Becoming a Data Head: How to Think, Speak, and Understand
Data Science by Gutman and Goldmeyer. This chapter covers the importance of data
quality and how to assess it. As you read, consider the following questions:

- What are the key factors that affect data quality?
- How can data quality be assessed?
- Why is the collection method important?

<!-- TODO: more content here linking the concepts back to the topic -->

## Activity 2.1.4

_Allow 1 hour_

You may find that the concepts introduced by Gutman and Goldmeyer are make you reconsider the dataset you found in Activity 2.1.1.  If so, take some time to revisit the dataset and consider how the concepts in the book apply to it.
