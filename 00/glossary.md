# Glossary
This glossary contains definitions of key terms and concepts related to data science, data analysis, and data management. It is intended to help readers understand and interpret technical terms and jargon commonly used in the field of data science. The glossary is organized alphabetically by term, with each term followed by a brief definition and explanation.

## A

## B

### Boolean

A boolean (or `bool`) is a data type that can have one of two values: `True` or `False`. Booleans are commonly used in programming to represent whether a condition is true or false. Booleans are named after the mathematician George Boole, who developed the mathematical theory of logic that underlies their use.

### Blob

A blob (Binary Large Object) is a data type used to store large binary data, such as images, audio files, or video files. Blobs are typically used in databases to store binary data such as image, sound, video that is too large to be stored in a regular text field.

### CRISP-DM

CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It is a widely used methodology for data mining projects. The CRISP-DM framework is a cyclical process that consists of six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. The CRISP-DM framework provides a structured approach to conducting data mining projects and ensures that all aspects of the project are considered. see also [SEMMA](#SEMMA), [PPDAC](#PPDAC) and [KDD](#KDD)

## D

### Data Dictonary

A data dictionary is a collection of metadata that describes the structure, content, and properties of a dataset. It provides information about the data elements, their relationships, and their meanings. A data dictionary can help users understand and interpret the data in a dataset, and can be used to ensure consistency and accuracy in data analysis and reporting.

### Data Cube

A data cube is a way of representing multidimensional data. The Scottish Statistics Agency has a good explanation of data cubes [here](https://statistics.gov.scot/help/data_cubes)

### DDL

DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define the structure of a database. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. Common DDL commands include `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, and `DROP TABLE`.

### DML

DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to manipulate data in a database. DML commands are used to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from database tables. Common DML commands include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT`.

## E

## F

## G

## H

## I

### Integer

An integer is a whole number that does not have a fractional or decimal part. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero. Examples of integers include -3, 0, and 42. In programming, integers (or `int`s) are commonly used to represent counts, quantities, and identifiers.

## J

## K

### KDD

KDD stands for Knowledge Discovery in Databases. It is the process of discovering useful knowledge from large volumes of data. The KDD process involves several steps, including data selection, data preprocessing, data transformation, data mining, and interpretation of the results. KDD is commonly used in data mining and machine learning to extract valuable insights from data.

## M

## N

## O

### Ordinal Data

Ordinal data is a type of data that can be ordered or ranked. It is a categorical data type that has a natural order, but the intervals between the categories are not necessarily equal. For example, a survey question that asks respondents to rate their satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5 is an example of ordinal data.

## P

### PPDAC

PPDAC stands for Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, and Conclusion. It is a framework commonly used in data science to guide the research process. The PPDAC framework helps to ensure that researchers are following a logical process and considering all aspects of their research.  See also [CRISP-DM](#CRISP-DM), [SEMMA](#SEMMA) and [KDD](#KDD)

### Pseudonymised

Personal data that has been pseudonymised has had all identifying information removed or replaced with a pseudonym. Pseudonymisation is a technique used to protect the privacy of individuals by making it more difficult to identify them from the data. It is often used in research and data analysis to comply with data protection regulations.

## Q

## R

### Relational Database

A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables. Each table consists of rows and columns, with each row representing a single record and each column representing a different attribute of the record. Relational databases are commonly used in applications that require complex data relationships and transactions. They are typically accessed using a language called SQL (Structured Query Language).

## S


### Semi-Structured Data

Semi-structured data is data that does not fit neatly into a structured format but has some organizational properties. It is typically organized in a hierarchical manner, with elements that have attributes or properties. Examples of semi-structured data include JSON and XML files. Semi-structured data is commonly found in web APIs and NoSQL databases.

### SEMMA

SEMMA stands for Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess. It is a data mining methodology developed by SAS Institute that outlines the steps involved in the data mining process. The SEMMA methodology helps to guide the data mining process and ensure that the results are accurate and reliable. see also [CRISP-DM](#CRISP-DM), [PPDAC](#PPDAC) and [KDD](#KDD)

### Structured Data

Structured data is data that is organized in a predefined manner. It is typically organized in rows and columns, and can be easily searched and analysed. It is the opposite of unstructured data, which is data that does not have a predefined data model or is not organized in a predefined manner.

## T

## U

### Univarate Data

Univariate data is data that consists of a *single variable or attribute*. It is the simplest form of data and is often used to describe the distribution of a single variable. Univariate data analysis involves examining the distribution of the data, identifying outliers, and summarizing the data using descriptive statistics.

### Unstructured Data

Unstructured data is data that does not have a predefined data model or is not organized in a predefined manner. It is typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. It is the opposite of structured data, which is data that is organized in a predefined manner.
