### Boolean

A boolean (or `bool`) is a data type that can have one of two values: `True` or `False`. Booleans are commonly used in programming to represent whether a condition is true or false. Booleans are named after the mathematician George Boole, who developed the mathematical theory of logic that underlies their use.

### Blob

A blob (Binary Large Object) is a data type used to store large binary data, such as images, audio files, or video files. Blobs are typically used in databases to store binary data such as image, sound, video that is too large to be stored in a regular text field.

### Data Dictonary

A data dictionary is a collection of metadata that describes the structure, content, and properties of a dataset. It provides information about the data elements, their relationships, and their meanings. A data dictionary can help users understand and interpret the data in a dataset, and can be used to ensure consistency and accuracy in data analysis and reporting.

### Integer

An integer is a whole number that does not have a fractional or decimal part. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero. Examples of integers include -3, 0, and 42. In programming, integers (or `int`s) are commonly used to represent counts, quantities, and identifiers.

### Ordinal Data

Ordinal data is a type of data that can be ordered or ranked. It is a categorical data type that has a natural order, but the intervals between the categories are not necessarily equal. For example, a survey question that asks respondents to rate their satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5 is an example of ordinal data.

### PPDAC

PPDAC stands for Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, and Conclusion. It is a framework commonly used in data science to guide the research process. The PPDAC framework helps to ensure that researchers are following a logical process and considering all aspects of their research. 

### Pseudonymised

Personal data that has been pseudonymised has had all identifying information removed or replaced with a pseudonym. Pseudonymisation is a technique used to protect the privacy of individuals by making it more difficult to identify them from the data. It is often used in research and data analysis to comply with data protection regulations.

### Structured Data

Structured data is data that is organized in a predefined manner. It is typically organized in rows and columns, and can be easily searched and analysed. It is the opposite of unstructured data, which is data that does not have a predefined data model or is not organized in a predefined manner.

### Semi-Structured Data

Semi-structured data is data that does not fit neatly into a structured format but has some organizational properties. It is typically organized in a hierarchical manner, with elements that have attributes or properties. Examples of semi-structured data include JSON and XML files. Semi-structured data is commonly found in web APIs and NoSQL databases.

### Unstructured Data

Unstructured data is data that does not have a predefined data model or is not organized in a predefined manner. It is typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. It is the opposite of structured data, which is data that is organized in a predefined manner.
